## Challenges
- My major challenge was the layouting; implementing the fixed and scrollable parts of the UI. I solved it with the help of flutter official docs, stack overflow and a sprinkle of trial and error.
- Writing this readme file because i didn't understand how to do half of what was requested. But with extensive research, I believe i have overcomed this challenge.
